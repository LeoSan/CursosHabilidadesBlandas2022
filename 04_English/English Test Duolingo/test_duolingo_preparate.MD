Debo tener tres speach 

1.- Describir un recuerdo con todos los elementos
que escuche, que vi, que oli, que saborie y que senti 

Sight: I remember the first time I saw the ocean. I was six years old, and my family had just arrived at the beach. I stood at the edge of the water, amazed by the vastness of it all. The waves crashed against the shore, and the sun sparkled on the surface of the water. I could see for miles in every direction, and the sky seemed to blend in with the ocean.

Sound: The sound of the waves was deafening, but it was also incredibly soothing. I could hear the seagulls crying overhead, and the children laughing as they played in the sand. There was a constant sense of movement and energy, but it was also peaceful and calming.

Smell: The air was filled with the smell of salt water and seaweed. It was a refreshing and invigorating scent, and it made me feel alive. I could also smell the sunscreen that my parents had put on me, and the coconut oil that I had put in my hair.

Taste: I remember eating a popsicle as I walked along the beach. The sweetness of the popsicle combined with the saltiness of the air was a delicious and unforgettable experience. I also remember drinking a lot of water, as it was a hot day and I was sweating a lot.

Touch: The sand was soft and warm beneath my feet. I could feel the sun on my skin, and the wind in my hair. The water was cool and refreshing, and it felt amazing to swim in it. I also remember the feeling of my family's arms around me as we watched the sunset together.

This memory is very special to me because it was the first time I had ever seen the ocean. It was a day that I will never forget.
