**Clase 10: Tips para una entrevista t√©cnica online**



**Clase 11: Habla de tu experiencia profesional en ingl√©s**


> ¬øComo resaltar en una entrevista de trabajo?
- El arte de la entrevista de trabajo se centra en c√≥mo presentamos nuestras experiencias previas. 
- Seg√∫n Eugenio Perea, utilizar el marco STAR (Situaci√≥n, Tarea, Acci√≥n, Resultado) al responder preguntas durante una entrevista para proporcionar respuestas claras y estructuradas. 
- Dirige la conversaci√≥n correctamente, incluso cuando las preguntas del entrevistador no sean claras, para destacar tus habilidades y experiencias de manera efectiva.

> ¬øQu√© es el marco de referencia STAR?
- STAR es un acr√≥nimo de las palabras en ingl√©s Situaci√≥n (Situaci√≥n), Task (Tarea), Action (Acci√≥n) y Result (Resultado). Vamos a desgranar cada uno de estos puntos para entender c√≥mo aplicar esta t√©cnica.

- Situaci√≥n: Comienza la narrativa exponiendo el contexto del desaf√≠o o proyecto que enfrentaste.
- Tarea: Define cu√°l fue tu responsabilidad o lo que se esperaba que lograras.
- Acci√≥n: Describe las acciones concretas que tomaste para abordar la tarea.
- Resultado: Culmina con el impacto o los resultados que generaron tus acciones

**Tips**
- Prepara historias que resalten tu participaci√≥n en proyectos importantes y preg√∫ntate a ti mismo c√≥mo aplicaste el marco STAR para resolver desaf√≠os. 
- Al contar tu historia, enf√≥cate en lo que hiciste y los pasos espec√≠ficos que tomaste para obtener resultados exitosos.
- Adoptar este esquema facilita la estructuraci√≥n de respuestas claras y concretas que demuestren tus capacidades a trav√©s de historias relevantes y positivas.

**¬øC√≥mo transmitir trabajo en equipo y resultados positivos?**
- Cuando relatas tus experiencias, es vital enfocarte en aspectos positivos, evitando comentarios negativos sobre personas o situaciones pasadas. 
- La meta es comunicar tu habilidad para contribuir de manera significativa y trabajar bien en equipo. Enf√≥cate en los resultados alcanzados gracias al trabajo en equipo. 
- Muestra c√≥mo las acciones colectivas del equipo llevaron al logro de metas, mejoraron la eficiencia o superaron desaf√≠os espec√≠ficos.

**¬øC√≥mo abordar la falta de experiencia laboral previa?**
- Para aquellos en b√∫squeda de su primera oportunidad laboral, Perea sugiere adaptar el marco STAR para ilustrar experiencias significativas fuera del √°mbito acad√©mico, como deportes o actividades extracurriculares, activismo pol√≠tico, para demostrar habilidades y logros. 
- Si no tienes experiencias externas, utiliza la misma estructura STAR para destacar logros en trabajos escolares y proyectos acad√©micos.

**¬øQu√© hacer si realmente no tienes experiencia ninguna?**
- Incluso si sientes que careces de experiencia laboral directa, las vivencias durante tus a√±os escolares pueden servir. 
- Cualquier proyecto, tarea en equipo o logro acad√©mico es aplicable dentro del enfoque STAR.
- Eugenio Perea enfatiza que la clave est√° en la manera de contar las historias y en la actitud positiva con la que se presentan. 
- Todos hemos trabajado de alguna forma a lo largo de nuestras vidas, y esas experiencias son valiosas.

**Aplica el marco STAR**
- Mant√©n presente estos consejos y aplica el marco STAR en tu pr√≥xima entrevista de trabajo. 
- Este m√©todo no solo te ayudar√° a estructurar mejor tus respuestas, sino que tambi√©n puede aumentar tus posibilidades de impresionar a los entrevistadores con narrativas claras y demostraciones efectivas de tus habilidades y logros. ¬°Adelante y mucha suerte!
