**Clase 10: Tips para una entrevista técnica online**



**Clase 11: Habla de tu experiencia profesional en inglés**


> ¿Como resaltar en una entrevista de trabajo?
- El arte de la entrevista de trabajo se centra en cómo presentamos nuestras experiencias previas. 
- Según Eugenio Perea, utilizar el marco STAR (Situación, Tarea, Acción, Resultado) al responder preguntas durante una entrevista para proporcionar respuestas claras y estructuradas. 
- Dirige la conversación correctamente, incluso cuando las preguntas del entrevistador no sean claras, para destacar tus habilidades y experiencias de manera efectiva.

> ¿Qué es el marco de referencia STAR?
- STAR es un acrónimo de las palabras en inglés Situación (Situación), Task (Tarea), Action (Acción) y Result (Resultado). Vamos a desgranar cada uno de estos puntos para entender cómo aplicar esta técnica.

- Situación: Comienza la narrativa exponiendo el contexto del desafío o proyecto que enfrentaste.
- Tarea: Define cuál fue tu responsabilidad o lo que se esperaba que lograras.
- Acción: Describe las acciones concretas que tomaste para abordar la tarea.
- Resultado: Culmina con el impacto o los resultados que generaron tus acciones

**Tips**
- Prepara historias que resalten tu participación en proyectos importantes y pregúntate a ti mismo cómo aplicaste el marco STAR para resolver desafíos. 
- Al contar tu historia, enfócate en lo que hiciste y los pasos específicos que tomaste para obtener resultados exitosos.
- Adoptar este esquema facilita la estructuración de respuestas claras y concretas que demuestren tus capacidades a través de historias relevantes y positivas.

**¿Cómo transmitir trabajo en equipo y resultados positivos?**
- Cuando relatas tus experiencias, es vital enfocarte en aspectos positivos, evitando comentarios negativos sobre personas o situaciones pasadas. 
- La meta es comunicar tu habilidad para contribuir de manera significativa y trabajar bien en equipo. Enfócate en los resultados alcanzados gracias al trabajo en equipo. 
- Muestra cómo las acciones colectivas del equipo llevaron al logro de metas, mejoraron la eficiencia o superaron desafíos específicos.

**¿Cómo abordar la falta de experiencia laboral previa?**
- Para aquellos en búsqueda de su primera oportunidad laboral, Perea sugiere adaptar el marco STAR para ilustrar experiencias significativas fuera del ámbito académico, como deportes o actividades extracurriculares, activismo político, para demostrar habilidades y logros. 
- Si no tienes experiencias externas, utiliza la misma estructura STAR para destacar logros en trabajos escolares y proyectos académicos.

**¿Qué hacer si realmente no tienes experiencia ninguna?**
- Incluso si sientes que careces de experiencia laboral directa, las vivencias durante tus años escolares pueden servir. 
- Cualquier proyecto, tarea en equipo o logro académico es aplicable dentro del enfoque STAR.
- Eugenio Perea enfatiza que la clave está en la manera de contar las historias y en la actitud positiva con la que se presentan. 
- Todos hemos trabajado de alguna forma a lo largo de nuestras vidas, y esas experiencias son valiosas.

**Aplica el marco STAR**
- Mantén presente estos consejos y aplica el marco STAR en tu próxima entrevista de trabajo. 
- Este método no solo te ayudará a estructurar mejor tus respuestas, sino que también puede aumentar tus posibilidades de impresionar a los entrevistadores con narrativas claras y demostraciones efectivas de tus habilidades y logros. ¡Adelante y mucha suerte!
